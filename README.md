# overlay4shim

This project will help people who want to put a layer with ANT data over the video recorded by Shimano Camera. 
It is intended for those who use linux and therefore, cannot use the app provided by Shimano.

The python script generates a sequence of png images to be used with OpenShot, that video editor will put together video and
sequence achiving thus a video with overlay.

I hope it can be helpful.
